#  How to Play Casino Card Activities Hemingway 

Casino card games are a great way to spend some free time, and they can also be profitable if you know how to play them well. In this article, we will teach you the basics of casino card games such as blackjack, poker, and baccarat.

# Blackjack 
Blackjack is the most popular casino card game in the world. The goal of blackjack is to accumulate cards with a value that is as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The player’s hand is compared against the dealer’s hand, and the player wins if their total is higher than the dealer’s total without going over 21.

There are several basic rules of blackjack that you should learn before playing: 
- You must hit if your hand is less than 17, and stand if your hand is 17 or more.
- Aces are worth 1 or 11, depending on what will help you get closer to 21.
- 10s and face cards are worth 10 each.
- If you have two cards of the same value (e.g. two kings), you can split them into two separate hands.

In order to win at blackjack, it is important to make smart decisions based on the cards that you are dealt. For example, if you have a hand of 17 and the dealer has a card of 2 showing, you should hit because there is a good chance that the dealer will bust (go over 21). However, if you have a hand of 9 and the dealer has a card of 3 showing, you should stand because there is a good chance that the dealer will bust and you will lose automatically if you hit.

# Poker 
Poker is another popular casino card game that can be played with either one or multiple decks of cards. The goal of poker is to beat your opponents by making the best five-card hand possible. There are many different types of poker games, but all variants follow basically the same rules: 
- Each player is dealt five cards face down. 
- The players then bet on who has the best hand (or bluff their opponents into folding). 
- The best five-card hand at the end wins the pot.

There are many different tips and tricks that can help you win at poker, but some general advice includes: 
- never bet more than you can afford to lose; 
- always keep track of what cards have been played (so you can bluff better); 
- watch your opponents for tells (signs that they may be bluffing).

# Baccarat 
Baccarat is another classic casino card game that can be played with either one or three decks of cards. In baccarat, each player bets on either Player or Banker winning (or a tie). The goal is to draw two hands (one for Player and one for Banker) with aggregate values as close as possible to 9.

There are only three choices in baccarat – Stand (keep current total), Draw (take another card), or Double down (double current total): 

Player: If total value = 5 or 6 then stand 7 8 or 9 then draw 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 double
