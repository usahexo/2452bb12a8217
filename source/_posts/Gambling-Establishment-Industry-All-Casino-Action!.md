The gambling industry has seen some pretty impressive growth in recent years. In 2015, it was worth an estimated $45.3 billion and is projected to grow to $55.5 billion by 2020. This growth is being driven by the increasing popularity of online gambling and the expansion of casino facilities into new markets around the world. The gambling industry is currently experiencing a period of consolidation, with large casino companies buying up smaller ones to expand their reach. Some of the biggest players in the industry include Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts, MGM Resorts International, and Caesars Entertainment Corporation. So what’s driving this growth? There are a few factors at work here. Firstly, there’s been a huge increase in online gambling over the past few years. In 2015, online gambling accounted for 34% of all global gambling revenues, up from 28% in 2010. This growth is being fueled by increasingly widespread access to broadband internet and growing acceptance of online gaming among consumers. Secondly, casinos are expanding into new markets around the world as regulations open up new opportunities for them. For example, Macau – which used to be a small Chinese territory – has now become the largest gambling market in the world thanks to relaxed regulations governing casinos there. Finally, there’s been a lot of consolidation within the gambling industry in recent years as big players jockey for position in this rapidly growing market. Large casino companies are buying up smaller ones in order to expand their geographic reach and gain access to new markets. All told, these factors are contributing to robust growth within the global gambling market, making it one of today’s most exciting industries to watch
