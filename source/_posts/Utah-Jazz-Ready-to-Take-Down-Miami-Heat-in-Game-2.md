#  Utah Jazz Ready to Take Down Miami Heat in Game 2

The Utah Jazz will take on the Miami Heat in Game 2 of their playoff series. The Jazz looked really good in their 116-108 victory in Game 1, and they should be able to win again in this one.

Gordon Hayward led the way for the Jazz in that first game with 26 points, while Rudy Gobert added 16 points and 14 rebounds. They will need another big outing from those two players if they want to win again tonight.

The Heat didnâ€™t have a great performance in Game 1, and things could get worse for them tonight. Goran Dragic was their leading scorer with just 20 points, while Hassan Whiteside had a disappointing game with just 10 points and nine rebounds.

It will be interesting to see how the Heat try to improve their performance in this one. They could certainly use a better effort from Dragic and Whiteside if they want to have any chance of winning.

Utah is a very good team, and they appear to be on track for a victory in this series. They should be able to take down the Heat again tonight and move one step closer to advancing to the next round
