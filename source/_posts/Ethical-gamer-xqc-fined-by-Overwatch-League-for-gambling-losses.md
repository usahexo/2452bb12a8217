#  Ethical gamer xqc fined by Overwatch League for gambling losses

In a controversial ruling, the Overwatch League has fined xqc for his involvement in illegal gambling. This comes as a surprise to many who feel that the league should be more focused on punishing players for cheating or bad behaviour, rather than penalising those who lost money in a game of chance.

xqc is not the only one to be hit with a fine - fellow player diablo has also been penalised - but he is the most high-profile player to be sanctioned so far. The Canadian gamer took to social media to express his anger at the decision, and many fans have come out in support of him.

There is no doubt that gambling can be addictive and harmful, but there are also many people who enjoy it responsibly. It seems unfair that those who lose money through no fault of their own should be punished, while cheaters and rule-breakers go unpunished.

Some have argued that the league should do more to educate players about the dangers of gambling, and provide them with support if they do become addicted. However, others feel that it is up to players to take responsibility for their own actions, and that the league has no obligation to help them.

What do you think? Should esports organisations be doing more to protect players from the dangers of gambling? Or is this a matter for the individual gamers themselves? Let us know in the comments below.

#  xqc's huge losses prompt renewed calls for regulation of esports betting

The recent news of xQc’s $30,000 losses in a single night playing crypto-currency games has renewed calls for regulation of esports betting.

xQc is one of the most popular professional gamers in the world, with more than 2 million followers on Twitch. He is also known for his outspoken personality and propensity for drama. So when word got out that he had blown through a large chunk of his earnings on gambling, people took notice.

Some members of the gaming community are criticising xQc for his irresponsible behaviour and calling for greater regulation of esports betting. Others are arguing that it is hypocritical to blame xQc for his losses when traditional sports are rife with gambling problems as well.

Whatever your opinion on the issue, it is clear that there is a growing concern around esports betting and its potential negative impact on gamers and the industry as a whole. So what exactly is happening with esports betting, and what can be done to control it?

To start with, let’s take a look at some of the numbers involved. In 2017, Ladbrokes reported that they had taken in £5 million in bets on esports matches, and this number is only going to continue to grow. Esports have become one of the most popular ways to bet on sports, and as the industry continues to grow, so too will the amount of money being wagered on it.

This presents a serious problem for two reasons: first, because young people are particularly vulnerable to addiction, and second, because the lack of regulation makes it easy for unscrupulous operators to prey on vulnerable gamblers.

Addictive behaviours are already a major issue in the world of gaming, and they are only going to become more prevalent as esports continue to grow in popularity. It is not hard to see how someone could get caught up in gambling addiction when there is so much money at stake and so many opportunities to place bets. And we have already seen cases where professional gamers have been ruined by their addiction to gambling.

Regulation is key if we want to protect gamers from these dangers. There need to be measures in place that prevent underage gambling and prohibit operators from taking advantage of vulnerable players. And above all, there needs to be education about the risks involved in betting on esports matches.


With so much money at stake, it is important that we take steps to ensure that esports betting does not have a negative impact on our community and our industry. Regulation is essential if we want to keep our players safe and protect our sport from exploitation by unethical operators.

#  Seattle Shock release xqc following gambling scandal

The Seattle Shock organization has released Dallas Fuel player xqc following a gambling scandal. The news comes just days after the Fuel released the same player for "making an inappropriate remark" on social media.

In a statement, the Shock said "The Seattle Shock organization condemns any form of gambling. We are saddened and disappointed to have to take this action but feel it is in the best interest of our team and our fans."

#  xqc ends up losing over $100,000 on online gambling

In a recent blog post, popular streamer and YouTuber Xqc admitted to losing over $100,000 on online gambling. The admission is surprising not only because of the amount of money at stake, but also because Xqc is usually quite open about his successes and failures in life.

Xqc started gambling a few years ago when he was going through a tough time emotionally. He found that the thrill of winning money made him feel better, and so he began to gamble more and more. Unfortunately, his addiction soon led him to lose a significant amount of money.

At first, Xqc tried to keep his gambling secret from his friends and family. But eventually he realized that he needed to get help, and he went to rehab last year. Since then, he has been trying to stay away from gambling altogether.

In his blog post, Xqc urged other people who are struggling with gambling addiction to seek help. He also thanked his supporters for sticking by him during this difficult time.
