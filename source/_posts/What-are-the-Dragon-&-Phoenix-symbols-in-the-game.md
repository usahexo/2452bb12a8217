#  What are the Dragon & Phoenix symbols in the game?

The Dragon and Phoenix symbols in the game represent two of the four mythical creatures known as the Chinese Four Symbols. The other two creatures are the Tiger and the Tortoise. Each creature is representative of an element, with the Dragon being representative of fire, the Phoenix being representative of air, the Tiger being representative of earth, and the Tortoise being representative of water.

The Chinese Four Symbols are often used in Feng Shui to help harmonize a space and bring good luck. In addition to appearing in slot games like 88 Fortunes, they can also be found on coins, stamps, paintings, and other forms of artwork from China.

There are many interpretations of what each creature represents, but some believe that the Dragon is a symbol of power and strength, while the Phoenix is a symbol of virtue and justice. There is also a legend that says if two people have different elements but are still compatible with each other, they will be blessed with an everlasting love. This is represented by the Dragon and Phoenix together.

#  What is the minimum bet amount in the game?

The answer to this question may vary, as it depends on the casino you are playing at. However, in general, the minimum bet amount is usually about $1 or less.

#  What are the payouts for each symbol combination?

When it comes to slot machines, one of the most important things players want to know is what the payouts are for each symbol combination. Different machines have different payout percentages, so it’s important for players to do their research before deciding which one to play.

There are a few different ways to find out the payouts for a particular slot machine. The first is to look online. Many casinos post the payout percentages for their machines on their websites. The second is to ask a casino employee. Most casinos have gaming attendants who can help players figure out how much they could potentially win on a particular machine. The third option is to take a look at the machine itself. Slot machines typically have payout tables posted on them, which list all of the different symbol combinations and how much they pay out.

No matter which method players choose, it’s important to be aware that not all slot machines are created equal. Some machines have higher payout percentages than others, so it’s always best to do some research before playing.
