#  Secrets Casinos Don't Want You to Know - House of Fun Edition

Did you know that casinos make more money from slots than they do from table games?  It's true - and it's because of the house edge.

The house edge is the percentage of each bet that the casino expects to keep in order to make a profit. For example, if the house edge on blackjack is 1%, that means the casino expects to keep 1% of all money that is wagered on blackjack. 

This percentage varies depending on the game. Slots have a much higher house edge than blackjack, which is why casinos make more money from them. 

But there are ways to reduce the house edge and give yourself a better chance of winning. Here are some tips:

* Play simple, easy to understand games with low house edges, like blackjack or craps.

* Avoid games like roulette, which have high house edges and are therefore not as favourable for players.

* Use smart betting strategies like basic strategy or counting cards in blackjack, or come bets in craps. This will help you cut down on the amount you lose to the casino.

* Stick to betting limits that you're comfortable with. Don't bet more money than you can afford to lose. 

By following these tips, you can reduce the house edge and give yourself a better chance of winning at casino games. Just remember - it's still a gamble, so don't bet more money than you can afford to lose!
