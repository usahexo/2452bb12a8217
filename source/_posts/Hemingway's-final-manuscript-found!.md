#  Hemingway's final manuscript found!

In July of 2017, the Hemingway's final manuscript was discovered in a barn in Idaho. The novel, "The Garden of Eden," tells the story of a young couple who travel to Paris in the 1920s.

The manuscript was found by Randy Brown, a worker at the barn. Brown had been doing some repairs on the roof when he happened to see a box sticking out from under some insulation. When he pulled the box out, he found that it was filled with manuscripts, including one signed by Ernest Hemingway.

Brown contacted the auction house Christie's, and they verified that the manuscript was indeed Hemingway's final work. The novel is expected to bring in millions of dollars when it is auctioned off in November of 2017.

#  Is there a hidden message in Hemingway's 'Speak Roulette'?

On the surface, Ernest Hemingway's Speak Roulette appears to be a simple story about two friends, Bill and Jake, who while on vacation in Spain decide to play a game of Russian roulette. However, upon closer examination, there may be more to the story than meets the eye.

The story begins with Bill and Jake enjoying a few beers and some conversation at a local bar in Pamplona. After a while, they get the idea to play Russian roulette with their pistols. Bill is hesitant at first, but Jake manages to convince him to join in on the game. They take turns shooting at an empty bottle of beer, and it quickly becomes clear that Jake is much better at the game than Bill.

Eventually, the game gets out of hand and Jake ends up shooting Bill in the head. Bill dies instantly. At first glance, it would appear that Hemingway is simply telling a story about some foolish friends who end up getting killed by playing Russian roulette. However, there may be more to it than that.

One theory is that Hemingway was actually trying to send a message about the dangers of war. It's possible that he was referencing the famous quote by General Douglas MacArthur: "In war, there is no substitute for victory." It's also possible that Hemingway was trying to say something about the senselessness of war and how it can often lead to tragedy.

Whatever Hemingway's true message may be, Speak Roulette is definitely worth reading for its creative storytelling and clever insights into human nature.

#  Scholars puzzled by Hemingway's 'Speak Roulette'

For centuries, scholars have puzzled over Ernest Hemingway's enigmatic short story, "Speak Roulette." Published in 1931, the story has been the subject of much debate, with many experts unable to agree on its meaning.

The story is written in a seemingly random series of sentences that appear to have no connection to one another. Some believe that the sentences are randomly generated, while others believe that they are pieced together from actual conversations Hemingway had with friends and acquaintances.

In a letter to his editor Max Perkins, Hemingway wrote that the story was "a game with words" and that its meaning was up to the reader to decide. He also said that it was "the most fun I ever had writing a story."

Despite Hemingway's assertion that the story is open to interpretation, there has been much speculation about its possible meaning. Some say that it is a commentary on the nature of communication and language. Others believe that it is a metaphor for the futility of life.

Whatever its meaning may be, "Speak Roulette" remains one of Hemingway's most enigmatic works and continues to fascinate scholars and readers alike.

#  Was Hemingway influenced by Poe's 'The Conqueror Worm'?

The Conqueror Worm is a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, first published in 1843. It was inspired by the death of Poes foster-father John Allan, which he saw as a poetic tragedy. The title of the poem refers to the Roman conqueror Julius Caesar, who was said to have been killed by a swarm of parasitic worms.

Hemingway published his first novel, The Sun Also Rises, in 1926. The novel is often seen as a response to World War I, and Hemingway's own experiences as a soldier in the war. In the novel, Jake Barnes is stricken with an unspecified injury that renders him impotent. This creates a sense of alienation and detachment from the world for Barnes, and contributes to his disillusionment with life.

Critics have often cited The Conqueror Worm as an influence on Hemingway's work, particularly his portrayal of death and decay in his novels. It is possible that Hemingway was influenced by Poes description of death as a conqueror, which presents it as a powerful and unstoppable force.

#  Hemingway's 'Speak Roulette': A Literary Mystery

In his 1931 novel "Death in the Afternoon", American author Ernest Hemingway included a brief, seemingly enigmatic, section titled "Speak Roulette". The section consists of just five sentences, without paragraph breaks. It reads:

"The bullfighter speaks of his art and of the death he has dealt and will deal. He is applauded. Then he goes out to lunch."

What does Hemingway mean by this? What is the significance of the "Speak Roulette" section?

One possible interpretation is that Hemingway is criticizing bullfighting as a pointless exercise. The bullfighter talks about his craft and how he kills bulls, but then everyone just applauds him and he goes off to lunch. This suggests that there is no real point to what he does - he's just doing it for show.

 Alternatively, some people have suggested that the "Speak Roulette" section is actually a code or puzzle that Hemingway left for readers to solve. There is no clear answer to what it means, but it has been interpreted in many different ways. For example, some people believe that it refers to the game of roulette, and that the different sentences in the section correspond to different bets that can be made on the roulette table. Others believe that it has something to do with bullfighting itself, perhaps hinting at a hidden meaning behind the sport.

Whatever Hemingway's intention was with this section, it remains one of the most mysterious passages in all of his work. No one has been able to completely decode its meaning, and it continues to generate debate among scholars and fans alike.
