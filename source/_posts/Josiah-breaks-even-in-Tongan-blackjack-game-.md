#  Josiah breaks even in Tongan blackjack game 

Josiah had a great time in Tonga. He learned a lot about the culture and the people. One of the things he enjoyed doing was playing blackjack with the locals. He was pretty bad at first, but he eventually got the hang of it.

One day, Josiah was playing blackjack with a group of locals and he managed to break even. This was a big accomplishment for him, since he usually lost money when he played. The locals were impressed by his skills and they offered to buy him a drink. Josiah gladly accepted their offer.

#  How to make an equilibrium in Tongan blackjack game 

The Tongan blackjack game is a casino game that is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by either getting 21 points on the first two cards (called a blackjack), or by reaching a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21. Points are scored as shown in the table below:

In Tongan blackjack, the player and dealer are both dealt two cards to start. The player's cards are face-up, while the dealer's cards are face-down. After each player has been dealt their cards, the first card in the dealer's hand is turned over (this is called "showdown"). If this card is an Ace, it counts as 1 point; if it is anything else, it counts as 10 points. The second card in the dealer's hand is turned over once both players have either stood or busted (ie gone over 21 points). 

The player can choose to either "stand" (stick with what they've got) or "hit" (take another card). If they hit and get another point total of 8 or less, they must take another card; otherwise they can stand. The same goes for the dealer - if their first card is an Ace, they must take another card; if not, they can stand. 

Whoever has the higher score at the end of these rounds wins. If both players have exactly 21 points, it's a draw and nobody wins or loses anything. 

Here's an example deal to illustrate how scoring works:

Player: 5 + 4 = 9 
Dealer: show down = 7 
First upcard for Dealer = 9


Since 5 + 4 = 9 < 10 (the value of the first upcard for dealer), player must hit again.

Second Cards: 7 + 3 = 10 > 9 (the value of Dealer's first downcard), so Dealer stands.

Player busts with 5 + 3 = 8 on their second turn and loses to Dealer's 7.

#  William's secret to winning Tongan blackjack

William is a seasoned blackjack player who has found success in playing the game in Tongan casinos. He has occasionally shared some of his secrets to winning, but he prefers to keep the finer details to himself. However, after much prodding from his friends, William has finally agreed to share some of the tactics he uses when playing the game.

The first strategy that William employs is to always play conservatively. He never bets more than 10% of his bankroll on any hand, no matter how good the odds may seem. By playing this way, William ensures that he doesn't lose too much money if he happens to go on a losing streak.

Another key component of William's strategy is to always know when to walk away from a hand. If the odds are against him and he doesn't have a strong hand, he will often times fold rather than risk losing even more money. This allows him to stay in the game longer and gives him better odds of winning in the long run.

Finally, William always makes sure to keep track of what cards have been played. By doing so, he can formulate a plan based on what cards are still left in the deck. This helps him make better decisions about whether or not to stay in a hand or fold.

While these tactics may not guarantee success every time, they have worked well for William in the past. By using these strategies, you too may be able to win your next game of blackjack in Tonga!
