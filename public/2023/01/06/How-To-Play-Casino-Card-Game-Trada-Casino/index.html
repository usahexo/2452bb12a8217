<h1 id="How-To-Play-Casino-Card-Game-Trada-Casino-Like-A-Pro"><a href="#How-To-Play-Casino-Card-Game-Trada-Casino-Like-A-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How To Play Casino Card Game Trada Casino Like A Pro!"></a>How To Play Casino Card Game Trada Casino Like A Pro!</h1><p>Slot games are generally the easiest games in any casino, but Curacao-licensed Trada Casino offers a unique variant that is both easy to play and potentially lucrative. The game is called Casino War, and it is based on a simple principle: players bet against the house on who will win a virtual card battle.</p>
<p>Casino War can be played with one to six decks of cards, and the player and dealer each receive one card. The player’s goal is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over, and if the player gets a blackjack (an ace and any other face card), they automatically win. If both the player and dealer have equally high card values, the game is a tie (or “push”) and no money changes hands.</p>
<p>In Casino War, the Ace is always worth 1 point, 2 through 10 are worth their face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are all worth 10 points. The suit of the card doesn’t matter. So if you are dealt an Ace of Spades and a 2 of Clubs, for example, your total score would be 3 (Ace&#x3D;1, 2&#x3D;2).</p>
<p>If you think the dealer has a lower hand than you (e.g., if they show an Ace), you can elect to “go to war” by betting an amount equal to your original wager. Both players reveal their cards simultaneously, and if the player has the higher value card they win two bets (the original bet plus the war bet). If the dealer has higher card value than the player, they lose both bets. If there is a tie, neither side wins or loses. </p>
<p>You can also choose not to go to war, in which case your original bet simply pushes (if it was not part of a winning blackjack hand). In order to help make informed decisions when playing Casino War, it is important understand what different card combinations mean:</p>
<p>· Two cards of same rank – This is known as a “pairs” and pays out at odds of 2-1<br>· Three of same rank – This is known as a “triple” and pays out at odds of 6-1<br>· Two cards of different rank - This is known as “anything else” or “outside bets” and pays out at even money (1-1)</p>
