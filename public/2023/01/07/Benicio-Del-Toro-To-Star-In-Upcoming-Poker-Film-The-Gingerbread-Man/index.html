The movie, titled The Gingerbread Man, is a crime thriller that takes place at a high stakes poker game.</p>
<p>Del Toro will play the role of Jack Spratt, a professional poker player who becomes involved in a dangerous game with some unsavory characters. The cast also includes Robert De Niro, Kenneth Branagh, and Famke Janssen.</p>
<p>The Gingerbread Man has been in development for several years, and Del Toro has been attached to the project since 2007. Filming is scheduled to begin in early 2014, and the movie is expected to be released later that year.</p>
<h1 id="Benicio-Del-Toro-Signs-On-For-Poker-Thriller-The-Dealer"><a href="#Benicio-Del-Toro-Signs-On-For-Poker-Thriller-The-Dealer" class="headerlink" title="Benicio Del Toro Signs On For Poker Thriller The Dealer"></a>Benicio Del Toro Signs On For Poker Thriller The Dealer</h1><p>Benicio Del Toro is in final negotiations to join the cast of “The Dealer,” a poker thriller being directed by Moritz Borman.</p>
<p>Del Toro will play a math genius who turned to a life of crime and now uses his intellect to win at poker. He falls afoul of the criminal underworld and is forced to take on a dangerous job.</p>
<p>The script by Alessandro Camon (“The Messenger”) was on the 2010 Black List. Principal photography is scheduled to start in September.</p>
<p>Del Toro is coming off his Oscar-winning performance in “The Wolfman.” His other recent credits include “Che” and “Inception.”</p>

<p>Preston was one of the most colorful and flamboyant figures in the history of professional poker, and was known for his fast talk and outrageous antics at the table. He won several high-profile tournaments during his career, including the prestigious World Series of Poker Main Event in 1972.</p>
<p>Del Toro is no stranger to playing colorful characters on screen; he won an Oscar for his portrayal of drug kingpin Franky Rivera in Steven Soderbergh’s Traffic, and has also starred in villainous roles in films such as The Usual Suspects and Sicario.</p>
<p>The Godfather of Poker will be directed by Thom Zimny, who previously worked with Del Toro on the HBO mini-series The Young Pope.</p>
<h1 id="Benicio-Del-Toro-Eyes-Biopic-About-Legendary-Poker-Player-Amarillo-Slim"><a href="#Benicio-Del-Toro-Eyes-Biopic-About-Legendary-Poker-Player-Amarillo-Slim" class="headerlink" title="Benicio Del Toro Eyes Biopic About Legendary Poker Player Amarillo Slim"></a>Benicio Del Toro Eyes Biopic About Legendary Poker Player Amarillo Slim</h1><p>Hollywood star Benicio Del Toro is planning to produce and star in a movie about the life of legendary poker player Amarillo Slim.</p>
<p>Slim, who died in March at the age of 83, was one of the most famous players in the world and was known for his flamboyant style and prodigious gambling skills.</p>
<p>He won several major tournaments during his career, including the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event in 1972.</p>
<p>Del Toro is said to be a big fan of Slim’s and has been wanting to make a movie about him for some time. He has now teamed up with production company Filmmakers Alliance to get the project off the ground.</p>
<p>“Amarillo Slim was an American icon and one of the most colorful characters ever to play poker,” Del Toro said in a statement. “I’m looking forward to telling his story onscreen.”</p>
<p>The film will be based on Slim’s autobiography, which tells the story of his rags-to-riches journey from poverty-ridden Texas to become one of the most successful players in history.</p>
<p>Del Toro is expected to start production on the movie later this year.</p>
<h1 id="Benicio-Del-Toro-To-Play-Professional-Poker-Player-In-The-Limit"><a href="#Benicio-Del-Toro-To-Play-Professional-Poker-Player-In-The-Limit" class="headerlink" title="Benicio Del Toro To Play Professional Poker Player In The Limit"></a>Benicio Del Toro To Play Professional Poker Player In The Limit</h1><p>Benicio Del Toro is set to play professional poker player in the Limit, a new film about the high-stakes world of tournament poker.</p>
<p>Del Toro will portray the fictional character of Cole, a successful but troubled professional poker player who is trying to make up for a past mistake. When he’s offered a chance to compete in the biggest tournament of his career, Cole must decide whether to risk everything or walk away with nothing.</p>
<p>The Limit is based on the true story of professional poker player and coach Barry Greenstein, who has won over $3 million in live tournaments. The screenplay was written by comedian and actor Norm Macdonald, himself an avid poker player.</p>
<p>“I have been playing poker for many years and have always been fascinated by the psychology of the game,” said Macdonald. “This movie will explore what it takes to be a successful poker player - the discipline, the strategy, and most importantly, the courage to risk it all.”</p>
<p> filming is scheduled to begin this fall in Los Angeles.</p>
