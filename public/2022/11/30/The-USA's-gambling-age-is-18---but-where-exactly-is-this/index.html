However, the majority of states have settled on 18 years old as the legal age to gamble.</p>
<p>Here’s a state-by-state look at gambling ages: </p>

Iowa allows those who are 18 years or older to play certain lottery games; allows those who are 19 years or older to enter casinos; allows those who are 21 years or older to possess and consume alcoholic beverages while on casino properties.

Kentucky permits anyone 18 or older to buy lottery tickets and play bingo; permits those 19 years or older to enter Keeneland Race Course and gamble in horse racing tracks; permits those 21 yearsold orolder to drink alcoholic beverages while on Keeneland Race Course premises .

<h1 id="Gambling-age-in-the-USA-set-at-18-but-what-states-allow-it"><a href="#Gambling-age-in-the-USA-set-at-18-but-what-states-allow-it" class="headerlink" title="Gambling age in the USA set at 18 - but what states allow it?"></a>Gambling age in the USA set at 18 - but what states allow it?</h1><p>Gambling is one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the United States. It is enjoyed by people from all walks of life and all age groups. The legal age to gamble in the US is 18, but there are a few states that allow gambling at 21.</p>
<p>The states where gambling is legal at 21 are Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio and Oregon.</p>
<p>The states where gambling is legal at 18 are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas California Connecticut Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico North Carolina Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to these rules. For example, in Nevada you can gamble at 18 inside a casino but you cannot purchase lottery tickets until you are 21. In Iowa you can buy lottery tickets at 18 but you cannot gamble in a casino until you are 21. There are also some tribal casinos that have their own rules when it comes to gambling age; usually it is either 18 or 21 depending on the tribe’s laws.</p>
<p>The majority of states allow gambling at 18 but there are still a good number of them that have the age set at 21. It is important to know the laws in your state before you decide to gamble. If you are caught gambling underage in a state where it is illegal to do so then you could face fines or even jail time.</p>
<h1 id="USA-sets-gambling-age-at-18-so-where-can-you-gamble"><a href="#USA-sets-gambling-age-at-18-so-where-can-you-gamble" class="headerlink" title="USA sets gambling age at 18 - so where can you gamble?"></a>USA sets gambling age at 18 - so where can you gamble?</h1><p>In the USA, gambling is considered an adult activity and is legal at 18 years old. However, this doesn’t mean that you can gamble just anywhere - there are specific places where gambling is legal and regulated.</p>
<p>Many states have casinos where people can gamble, and there are also a number of states that have lotteries. In some states, you can also bet on sports or horses. There are even a few states where you can play poker in a casino or online.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to gamble, it’s important to do your research and find out where gambling is legal in your state. You don’t want to risk getting in trouble with the law by trying to gamble in an illegal venue.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-age-in-the-USA-remains-at-18-find-out-where-you-can-gamble-here"><a href="#Gambling-age-in-the-USA-remains-at-18-find-out-where-you-can-gamble-here" class="headerlink" title="Gambling age in the USA remains at 18 - find out where you can gamble here!"></a>Gambling age in the USA remains at 18 - find out where you can gamble here!</h1><p>Gambling age in the United States of America is 18 years old, but this is not the same for all states. In some states, gambling age is 21 years old, and in a few it is even higher. So if you are planning on gambling when you are in the US, be sure to check the legal age requirement for that particular state.</p>
<p>There are many types of gambling available in the USA. The most popular and well-known are casino games such as slots, blackjack, and roulette. There are also state lotteries, horseracing, dog racing, and charity bingo games.</p>
<p>Casinos can be found in many states across America. Nevada is probably the most famous for its casinos - Las Vegas in particular - but there are also casinos in New Jersey, California, Mississippi, and other states. Lotteries are available in most states too. The Powerball lottery is particularly well-known and has jackpots that often run into hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to place a bet on a horse race or track then you’ll need to head to one of the states that offers horseracing. The most popular destination for horseracing bets is undoubtedly Florida, but tracks can also be found in California, Texas, New York, and other states. Dog racing is only available in a few states - including Florida and West Virginia - while charity bingo can be played in just about any state that has a population large enough to support it.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the gambling age varies from state to state within America. You can see a list of all the states with their respective gambling ages below: </p>
<p>Alabama - 21<br>Alaska - 18<br>Arizona - 21<br>Arkansas - 21<br>California - 21<br>Colorado - 18<br>Connecticut - 18<br>Delaware - 18<br>Florida - 21<br>Georgia - 21<br>Hawaii - 21<br>Idaho - 18 </p>
<p>Illinois - 21<br>Indiana - 21<br>Iowa - 18</p>

But where can they do this? Check out our guide to the best gambling destinations in the USA!</p>
<p>Las Vegas is probably the most well-known gambling destination in the USA. With its luxurious hotels and casinos, it’s no wonder that people come from all over to try their luck. There are plenty of different casino games to choose from, as well as other entertainment options such as shows and nightclubs.</p>
<p>Atlantic City is another popular gambling destination. It has a more laid-back atmosphere than Las Vegas, and is a great place to relax and gamble. There are a range of casinos to choose from, as well as a few interesting tourist attractions such as the Atlantic City Boardwalk.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more rural gambling experience, then head to Missouri. The state has over 120 casinos, many of which are located in small towns. This is a great opportunity to enjoy some traditional American gaming like craps and blackjack in an authentic setting.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something a bit different, then why not try Oregon? This state is home to some of the country’s most unique casinos, including one that is housed inside a giant tree! There are also plenty of slot machines available if you want to try your luck on something new.</p>
