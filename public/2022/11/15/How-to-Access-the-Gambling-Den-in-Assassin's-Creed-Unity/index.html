The entrance is located in a small alleyway just south of the river, but it’s heavily guarded by two large gatekeepers.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to get around these gatekeepers, however. One is to use your Eagle Vision to identify the guard on the right who isn’t paying attention. You can then climb up on the roof of the adjacent building and jump onto the balcony he’s guarding. From there, you can simply walk right past him into the Gambling Den.</p>
<p>Another way is to use your assassin skills to take out both gatekeepers. This can be done by sneaking up behind them and assassinating them, or throwing a smoke bomb at them and then stabbing them while they’re coughing.</p>
<p>Once you’re inside, you’ll find that the Gambling Den is a pretty luxurious place. It’s decked out with marble floors, ornate columns, and plush furniture. There are also several gaming tables where you can play various games of chance, as well as a bar where you can buy drinks.</p>
<p>The den is crawling with guards, so be careful not to get caught trespassing. If you’re spotted, you’ll likely be thrown out onto the streets where it’s unlikely that you’ll able to get back in.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Get-Inside-the-Gambling-Den-in-Assassin’s-Creed-Unity"><a href="#How-to-Get-Inside-the-Gambling-Den-in-Assassin’s-Creed-Unity" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Inside the Gambling Den in Assassin’s Creed Unity"></a>How to Get Inside the Gambling Den in Assassin’s Creed Unity</h1><p>A quick guide on how to enter the gambling den in Assassin’s Creed Unity.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You will first need to complete the main story mission “An Old Friend” which can be found in the second district of Paris - the Marais. This mission will introduce you to Marquis de Sade and will allow you access to the gambling den.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once you have completed the “An Old Friend” mission, head back to the Marais district and locate the gambling den which is located in an alley off of Rue des Rosiers. The entrance is guarded by two men so beat them up and proceed inside.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As soon as you enter, you will be attacked by several enemies so take them out and then make your way upstairs. There are three levels in total inside the gambling den, each with its own set of enemies and challenges.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The objective inside the gambling den is to find de Sade and defeat him. However, it’s not as easy as it sounds as he is surrounded by several guards and can be quite tricky to take down. Use cover wisely and try not to attract too much attention or you will quickly find yourself overwhelmed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once de Sade has been defeated, return to François-Thomas Germain for your reward and congratulations - you have now completed all of the main story missions in Assassin’s Creed Unity!</p>
</li>

<h1 id="The-Gambling-Den-in-Assassin’s-Creed-Unity-How-to-Enter"><a href="#The-Gambling-Den-in-Assassin’s-Creed-Unity-How-to-Enter" class="headerlink" title="The Gambling Den in Assassin’s Creed Unity - How to Enter"></a>The Gambling Den in Assassin’s Creed Unity - How to Enter</h1><p>The gambling den in Assassin’s Creed Unity is an interesting place. It’s not clear at first how to get in, but there are a few ways. In this article, we’ll take a look at how to get into the gambling den in Assassin’s Creed Unity.</p>
<p>There are several ways to get into the gambling den in Assassin’s Creed Unity. The first way is to find it while on a mission. The second way is to unlock it using the Helix Rift exploit. The third way is to use the Freedom Cry DLC.</p>
<p>If you’re playing through the main story, you’ll likely come across the gambling den during a mission. However, if you’re playing through one of the side missions, you may not come across it until later on. If you’re having trouble finding it, head to the Palais Royale and look for the large dome. Once you’re inside, make your way up to the second floor and look for a door that says “Privé.”</p>
<p>If you’re looking to enter the gambling den without having to play through the main story or any of the side missions, you can use the Helix Rift exploit. This exploit allows you to access locked areas and items that are normally unavailable. To do this, you’ll need a Helix Rift token and an Xbox One controller (or another controller that works with Windows).</p>
<p>First, select “Exit Game” from the main menu and choose “Yes” when asked if you want to save your progress. Then, open up Ubisoft Club on your computer and sign in using your account information. After that, select “Assassin’s Creed Unity” from the menu on the left and choose “Enter Code.” Finally, enter the code “P7C3J-BZ63B-XHBTJ-KCBJJ-9WRMT” and press “Submit.”</p>
<p>You should now see a new option called “Rift Tokens.” Select this option and then select “Redeem.” You’ll then be prompted to enter your Ubisoft Club username and password again. After that, select “Assassin’s Creed Unity” from the menu on the left and choose “Enter Code.” Finally, enter the code “DQB3W-FCHC6-T9WCK-3JJ33-ZW6TJ” and press “Submit.”</p>
<p>You should now have two free Helix Rift tokens! To use them, start up Assassin’s Creed Unity and select “Play Game.” Then, choose either Solo or Co-Op mode and select “Paris Stories - Episode 2: The Gambling Den.” Once you’re inside, open up your inventory by pressing RB&#x2F;LB + BACK&#x2F;SELECT or by pressing I on your keyboard. Finally, select one of your free tokens (they will have a symbol of two dice next to them) and click on “Use Token.” You should now be able to access everything inside of the gambling den!</p>
<p>If you own Assassin’s Creed Freedom Cry (the DLC for Assassin’s Creed Unity), there’s another way to get into the gambling den. First, start up Assassin’s Creed Freedom Cry and choose either Solo or Co-Op mode. Next, select “Episode 4: Aiding The Rebels.” Once you’re inside, open up your inventory by pressing RB&#x2F;LB + BACK&#x2F;SELECT or by pressing I on your keyboard. Finally, select one of your free tokens (they will have a symbol of two dice next to them) and click on “Use Token.” You should now be able to access everything inside of the gambling den!</p>
<h1 id="Precisely-How-Do-I-Get-Into-the-Gambling-Den-in-Assassin’s-Creed-Unity"><a href="#Precisely-How-Do-I-Get-Into-the-Gambling-Den-in-Assassin’s-Creed-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Precisely How Do I Get Into the Gambling Den in Assassin’s Creed Unity?"></a>Precisely How Do I Get Into the Gambling Den in Assassin’s Creed Unity?</h1><p>There is no one definitive way to do this, but here are some methods that should work.</p>
<p>One way is to enter the building through the roof. You can either use a Rope Dart to grapple onto the roof and then climb up, or use a Parachute to land on it.</p>
<p>Once you’re on the roof, you can switch to Eagle Vision and look for a beam that you can walk across to get to the next roof. Then, drop down onto the balcony of the gambling den.</p>
<p>Another way is to enter through the front door. There is usually a guard posted in front, so you’ll need to take him out first. Once he’s down, enter the building and head up the stairs to the gambling den.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Gain-Access-to-the-Gambling-Den-in-Assassin’s-Creed-Unity"><a href="#How-to-Gain-Access-to-the-Gambling-Den-in-Assassin’s-Creed-Unity" class="headerlink" title="How to Gain Access to the Gambling Den in Assassin’s Creed Unity"></a>How to Gain Access to the Gambling Den in Assassin’s Creed Unity</h1><p>If you’re looking to access the hidden gambling den in Assassin’s Creed Unity, then look no further. This guide will take you through the steps necessary to gain access to this exclusive area.</p>
<p>First things first, you’ll need to complete the game’s main story mission. Once that’s done, you’ll need to head to the Sainte Chapelle district in Paris. From there, find the building marked with a treasure chest and make your way inside. Climb to the top of the building and synchronize with the Viewpoint.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll need to head to the next district – Les Halles. Find the building located near the fast-travel point and make your way inside. You’ll find a set of stairs on the ground floor – climb them and make your way to the roof. There, you’ll find another Viewpoint which you’ll need to synchronize with.</p>
<p>Next, travel to the area known as La Bièvre and find the large building located near one of the fast-travel points. You’ll find a set of stairs on the side of the building – climb them and make your way to the roof. There, you’ll find another Viewpoint which you’ll need to synchronize with.</p>
<p>Lastly, travel to Place des Vosges and find Arno’s house (it’s marked on your map). Once there, ascend the nearby ladder and synchronize with the Viewpoint on top of Arno’s house.</p>
<p>With all four Viewpoints synchronized, a secret entrance will now be unlocked near Arno’s house. Head inside and make your way down into the hidden gambling den!</p>
