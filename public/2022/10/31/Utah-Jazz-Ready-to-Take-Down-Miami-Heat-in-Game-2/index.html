The Jazz looked really good in their 116-108 victory in Game 1, and they should be able to win again in this one.</p>
<p>Gordon Hayward led the way for the Jazz in that first game with 26 points, while Rudy Gobert added 16 points and 14 rebounds. They will need another big outing from those two players if they want to win again tonight.</p>
<p>The Heat didn’t have a great performance in Game 1, and things could get worse for them tonight. Goran Dragic was their leading scorer with just 20 points, while Hassan Whiteside had a disappointing game with just 10 points and nine rebounds.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how the Heat try to improve their performance in this one. They could certainly use a better effort from Dragic and Whiteside if they want to have any chance of winning.</p>
<p>Utah is a very good team, and they appear to be on track for a victory in this series. They should be able to take down the Heat again tonight and move one step closer to advancing to the next round</p>
<h1 id="George-Hill-Leads-Utah-Jazz-to-Victory-Over-Miami-Heat"><a href="#George-Hill-Leads-Utah-Jazz-to-Victory-Over-Miami-Heat" class="headerlink" title="George Hill Leads Utah Jazz to Victory Over Miami Heat"></a>George Hill Leads Utah Jazz to Victory Over Miami Heat</h1><p>George Hill led the Utah Jazz to a 114-103 victory against the Miami Heat with 22 points on Monday night. Derrick Favors contributed 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Jazz, who have won their past two games after starting the season 0-4.</p>
<p>Gordon Hayward led all scorers with 28 points for the Heat, who have lost two in a row and three of their past four games. Hassan Whiteside added 20 points and 17 rebounds in the loss.</p>
<p>Hill shot 8 for 16 from the field and made four 3-pointers for Utah. He had seven assists and five rebounds. Favors shot 6 for 10 from the field. Hayward was 11 for 21 from the field and hit six 3-pointers. He also had five assists and four rebounds.</p>
<p>Whiteside shot 10 for 17 from the field and grabbed eight offensive rebounds. Goran Dragic scored 20 points and had nine assists while shooting 8 for 14 from the field. Tyler Johnson scored 19 points while shooting 8 for 13 from the field off the bench for Miami.</p>
<h1 id="Goran-Dragic-Hassan-Whiteside-Struggle-as-Utah-Jazz-Win"><a href="#Goran-Dragic-Hassan-Whiteside-Struggle-as-Utah-Jazz-Win" class="headerlink" title="Goran Dragic, Hassan Whiteside Struggle as Utah Jazz Win"></a>Goran Dragic, Hassan Whiteside Struggle as Utah Jazz Win</h1><p>MIAMI - Goran Dragic and Hassan Whiteside each tallied 16 points, but it wasn’t nearly enough as the Utah Jazz topped the Miami Heat, 103-91, on Saturday night at AmericanAirlines Arena.</p>
<p>Alec Burks led all players with 23 points off the bench for Utah (21-28), which snapped a four-game losing streak. Rudy Gobert finished with 18 points and 12 rebounds, while Rodney Hood chipped in 17 points.</p>
<p>“It feels good,” Hood said afterward. “We’ve been struggling lately and we needed this win.”</p>
<p>Miami (25-26) committed 22 turnovers that led to 26 Utah points. The Jazz also held a 46-38 rebounding edge.</p>
<p>“They were just more physical than us,” Dragic said. “They got every rebound, they contested every shot. We didn’t play our game.”</p>
<p>Whiteside agreed.</p>
<p>“They were just more aggressive than us,” he said. “They wanted it more.”</p>

After dropping their fourth consecutive game on Saturday night to the Utah Jazz, 103-91, they are still very much alive in the race for one of the final three postseason spots - though time is running short.   </p>
<h1 id="Utah-Jazz’-Rudy-Gobert-Dominates-Miami-Heat-in-Game-2"><a href="#Utah-Jazz’-Rudy-Gobert-Dominates-Miami-Heat-in-Game-2" class="headerlink" title="Utah Jazz’ Rudy Gobert Dominates Miami Heat in Game 2"></a>Utah Jazz’ Rudy Gobert Dominates Miami Heat in Game 2</h1><p>In game 2 of their playoff series against the Miami Heat, the Utah Jazz looked to Rudy Gobert to lead them to victory. And that he did.</p>
<p>Gobert was dominant on both ends of the court, scoring 24 points while also grabbing 12 rebounds and blocking 5 shots. His play was a big reason why the Jazz were able to come away with a 116-108 victory, tying up the series at 1 game apiece.</p>
<p>For the Heat, Hassan Whiteside had a tough night. He finished with just 12 points and 8 rebounds, while also committing 5 fouls.</p>
<p>The Jazz will now look to Gobert to continue his dominant play in game 3, which is scheduled for Thursday night in Miami.</p>
<h1 id="Donovan-Mitchell-Powers-Utah-Jazz-Over-Miami-Heat-in-Game-2"><a href="#Donovan-Mitchell-Powers-Utah-Jazz-Over-Miami-Heat-in-Game-2" class="headerlink" title="Donovan Mitchell Powers Utah Jazz Over Miami Heat in Game 2"></a>Donovan Mitchell Powers Utah Jazz Over Miami Heat in Game 2</h1><p>Donovan Mitchell exploded for a playoff career-high 35 points to help the Utah Jazz take a 2-0 series lead against the Miami Heat with a 116-108 victory on Monday night.</p>
<p>“I thought he was terrific,” Jazz head coach Quin Snyder said of Mitchell. “He was aggressive, made plays, got to the free throw line. I think he just has a will to win.”</p>
<p>Mitchell shot 14-of-26 from the field and 7-of-8 from the free throw line while also contributing five rebounds, four assists and three steals in 36 minutes.</p>
<p>“I was just trying to be aggressive,” Mitchell said. “They were leaving me open and I just took it upon myself to knock down shots.”</p>
<p>The 21-year-old rookie led the Jazz in scoring during the regular season and has continued his hot streak into the postseason. He is now averaging 27.5 points per game in the playoffs.</p>
<p>“He’s a gamer,” Jazz center Rudy Gobert said of Mitchell. “He’s been doing that all year long. He wants to win and he’s doing whatever it takes.”</p>
<p>Gobert chipped in with 16 points and 14 rebounds while Ricky Rubio added 18 points and 10 assists for Utah. Goran Dragic led Miami with 28 points while Dwyane Wade added 23 points and eight assists off the bench.</p>
<p>The series now shifts to Miami for Game 3 on Thursday night.</p>
